# Elements

Elements are the various design patterns used in a Theme. Elements usually include HTML markup and can be configured by using Settings for the Element accessed via the gear icon in the front-end. Elements can also include logic by using Twig in the markup to do things like show or hide certain things depending on the conditions you set in the Settings.
